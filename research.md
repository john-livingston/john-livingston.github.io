# Research

I enjoy discovering extrasolar planets using a combination of ground- and space-based telescopes. I am interested in the various processes that give rise to the great diversity of worlds in the universe. I work with several international collaborations focused on the NASA K2 and TESS missions, including [this one](http://kesprint.science/). A full listing of my work can be found on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Livingston6), and below are my first-author papers:
