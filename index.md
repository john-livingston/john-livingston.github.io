## Research

I enjoy [discovering and characterizing extrasolar planets](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aaa841/meta) using a combination of ground- and space-based telescopes. I am interested in the various processes that give rise to the great diversity of worlds in the universe.

## Community

I am an organizer of the [Tokyo Area Planetary Science](http://tokyoplanets.github.io) meetings.

## Experience

I have at various times been employed in the following capacities:

- Driving the picker cart that everyone tries to hit with golf balls at the driving range
- Making caff√® lattes and cappuccinos with the right amount of milk froth
- Playing guitar (both solo and in bands)
- Developing code to analyze data from the Spitzer space telescope, as a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
- Hunting for planets using data from the Kepler space telescope, as a fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science
