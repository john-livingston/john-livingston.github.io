### PhD student at the University of Tokyo

## Research

I enjoy discovering and characterizing extrasolar planets using a combination of ground- and space-based telescopes. I am interested in the various processes that give rise to the great diversity of worlds in the universe.

## Community

I am an organizer of the [Tokyo Area Planetary Science](http://tokyoplanets.github.io) meetings.

## Experience

I have at various times been employed in the following capacities:

- Driving the cart that everyone tries to hit with golf balls at the driving range
- Playing guitar, both solo and in bands
- Making delicious cafe lattes and cappuccinos, with just the right amount of froth
- Developing code at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to analyze data from the Spitzer space telescope
- Hunting for planets using data from the Kepler space telescope, as a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science
