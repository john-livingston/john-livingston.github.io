# Mentoring

I've been very fortunate to have the opportunity to mentor some excellent students starting their graduate careers at the University of Tokyo. We've been working on fun things like transit modeling of [TRAPPIST-1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Mayuko-Mori/TRAPPIST-1_transit/blob/master/The%20Light%20Curve%20Analysis%20of%20TRAPPIST-1d%26e%20transits.ipynb) and some [hot Jupiters](https://jpdeleon.github.io/2017-08-05-Parameter_estimation_transit_/). I also helped a student in Sri Lanka discover his first two planets and publish his first [paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/488/1/536/5519234).
