# 2019 nCoV

I enjoy exploring and visualizing public datasets, so naturally the novel coronavirus 2019 nCoV caught my attention -- after the initial outbreak in China, the rest of the world is now struggling with massive contagion and the situation has now been classified as a pandemic:

![](/assets/images/deaths_total.png){:width="900px"}

Clearly, the spread of the disease has really accelerated outside of China since late February. This can be seen in more detail on a per-country basis:

The slope of the growth in cases is currently steepest in the US, while it is flat in China. This can also be seen in the daily increase in cases (lower panel). In terms of deaths, however, Italy and Spain currently face the most dire situation:

However, if we account for differences in population, the situation looks a bit different:

![](/assets/images/deaths_top10_pc.png){:width="900px"}

San Marino and the Holy See (aka Vatican City) are geographically within Italy, and Andorra is next to Spain, so this is not too surprising given their small populations. Iceland has tested every single citizen, so their numbers are most likely more complete (accurate). Dominica, however, is located in the Caribbean and has a small population, but their numbers may not be reliable.
